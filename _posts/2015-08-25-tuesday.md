Today, we mainly discussed about scholarships and ways to have a good scholarship essay. We went through some papers that were printed out and discussed the authors’ writing style as well as the common style. Also, when we were surfing the net for some websites of organizations that offer volunteering work, Greg warned me about the fact that there are some organizations that should not be trusted. And, he taught me how to check if an organization is trust-worthy which was really helpful. In today’s class, I found out that there are a lot of things I need to improve on so I really look forward to doing so in next classes.
