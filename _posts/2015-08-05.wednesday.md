Today, Greg gave me the book about Sherlock Holmes. After that, we started the class with a video and then spent a lot of time going through the vocabulary paper. There were many words I found very interesGrrting and helpful. Finally, we did a discussion and another video. At the end of the class, I realized that my communicating skills have improved thanks to Greg. I hope to improve other skills as we continue our journey
