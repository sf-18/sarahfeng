Today, we spent the first hour looking through my latest essay on Brave New World. The topic was discussing if John was more free than World State citizens and if he was conditioned in his own way. The essay was not so good as I expected, or compared to the previous one, but I look forward to learning from these things as we go along. We also did some talking and a video about which I do not remember. Nevertheless, it seems promising that I will learn and improve a lot by the time I go abroad
