In the first hour of today’s lesson, we took some time to review the last class which we had on Skype about “To Kill A Mocking Bird” and some relating details. The rest of the class, we discussed about the contents of the movie TKM I watched. In the second hours, we also did some videos, listed the charactersitics of each character and continued discussing. I think it is really exciting and interesting to study about TKM, and, like “Brave New World”, it opens my eyes to lots of new things.
