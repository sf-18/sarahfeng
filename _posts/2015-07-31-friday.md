In the first hour of today’s lesson, we spent time watching some videos and discussing about ‘Brave New World’. It was a story about the future when people are all created by machines and conditioned to do particular tasks right after being born. It shows a great connection between religion, science and political power. In the second hour, I spent time writing a paragraph on the relationship of these three social aspects. It was good to know that I have picked up some new ways of using words in writing asssignments. I want to improve more and more after each class.
