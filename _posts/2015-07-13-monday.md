Today, Greg helped me a lot with my Ipod touch to make it work again. Also, Iâ€™ve joined dukejournal on Github. There are a lot of new things up there. Greg showed me that there are many things that I have to learn to prepare fro my future. I am looking forward to obtaining all the knowledge from him
